to set the path, add the following to ~/.bashrc or ~/.profile or both.

user=`id -u -n`
source /$user/QuickDirs/apps/startup/setup.sh

You can also just do:
cp setup.sh > /usr/bin/@qd-setup
chmod u+x setup.sh > /usr/bin/@qd-setup

and run 
    source @qd-setup 

when you want to start using quick directories.
